BUSINESS TASKS

To analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. 


Questions to answer includes

What are some trends in smart device usage? 

How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers? 

How could these trends help influence Bellabeat's marketing strategy?





DATA SOURCE

Data was gotten from FitBit Fitness Tracker Data on Kaggle. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.




Data Limitations

Data was collected from customers whose demographic details (age, gender etc) were unknown.
The dataset is not up-to-date
The dataset was inconsistent with the 30 expected users. DailyActivity, DailyCalories, DailyIntensities and DailySteps tables all had 33 users. SleepDay table had 24 users, while weightLogInfo has 8 users



Data Cleaning

The dataset in CSV format was imported into excel for cleaning. All hourly data were merged into one sheet, as was with the daily activities. Date/Time was properly formatted into Date or time.



Data Analysis

From the analysis, the users had an average step count of 7638 per day.
The average Heart rate was about 77 beats per minute
Users spent more time in a sedentary position throughout their day. This could be due to hours at work and/or hours spent sleeping
Time spent being active is quite limited
And finally, we saw a positive relationship between the distance covered by users and the number of calories burnt, which could provide a lot of health pointers to the users



Recommendations

Data shown from the analysis helps understand how users currently use smart devices. A lot of data quality and tidiness issues were faced with the dataset during the analysis

The number of entries for the weight data was quite low, this could be because it required manual data entry or the process of data entry was tedious and/or hard to carry out. Future products can look into making this process easier.
Users' average steps, distance covered or active minutes were quite low. They spent a lot of time being in sedentary states. Future products could recommend required steps or activity levels to users and send notifications either when this is achieved or not achieved.
Future campaigns should be focused on the health benefits of being and staying active, which will encourage users to use their apps more to track their health levels.
